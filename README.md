This GUI app is a macro wrapper on PDFill's watermarking tool (https://www.pdfill.com/pdf_tools_free.html). Because of how slow and inefficient PDFill is for its watermarking, I made a wrapper to automate the repetitive task of selecting and watermarking files with just the given footer and header details. The alignment and other things are also saved on first input, so all documents have symmetrically aligned watermark.

It takes about 40 seconds on an average to watermark, add footer text and split the pages. Initailly it took 2 mins per document. This now makes it much quicker and saves a lot of time
